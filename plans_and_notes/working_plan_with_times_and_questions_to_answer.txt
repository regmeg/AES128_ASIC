######################### Do as minimum as possible in order to make it complete  chip first - encoder (no ecc, decription) - c model, arch, verilog,systemverilog, FPGA(emulation)
#################################
Work plan for final year project.

Question you have to answer before starting programming (15.5 hours in total - two days of work) - work on te quesiton you have to naswre.
	* what is finite Galois Field implemenenation for 256 elements (1byte) and how you do add substract, multiply divide in it ? (2hours) - many days spent
            1. eucledian algorithm - 45 mins - so far - 15 + 120 + 5 = 140 min - 2 hour 20 mins
            2. work through rest of two papers for 2^8 (2 hours)

	*what is sbox matrix and how do you generated ? (1 hours)
	* By the definition in order to perform MixCollumn each column in the State matrix should be treated as polynomial in the GF(2^8) field and then multiplied by the modulo x4+1, as it is show in [9, 10]. (1hour)
	* once you understand the finite field, understand how the mmatrix for performing multicollums is being generated. (1hour)
	*. are new rows for round keys in key exansion generated using just xor or the whole operation - take a look at the official spec ? (1hours)
	*How is the key being generated, stored and transmitted (key generator module ?) what key sizes are you going to work with ? (1.5 hours)  do you even need module for a key - it might need to transmitter somewhere else.
	*How diligent should you be with the C++ coding, can you implement it in systemverilog coding later on ? (2hours)
	*What kind of C model are you going to create ? (temporal unitmed model - as simple as possble - read on it) (1hours)
	*Programming plan (make this plan after you've answered the previous questions)
--------------------------------------------------------------

Things to be dones after the first C model C model
##################
Review time waster points (little reaseach as possible)
#################

*Your project plan pretty much is given in your lit review
*Architecture of the chip - plan what the outlay of the chip is going to be and what algorithms do they implement (design pseudo codes before the acutal verilog codes) - how are modules interacting, what signals do they exchange with.
*Test plan - functionality that should be tested in 
---------------------------------
Questions to think on later on -
	*what are real life uses of your chip (name couple of real applications) - there is going to be quesiton like that for sure.
	*can you use UVM ? read on UVM and OVM ( they are about 200 pages each, you have to know the differnce, as you pretty much worked on OVM before - do not read the spec. find a summary and then decide if you need it.
	*when writing the report, pay attention to the writing guidlines (styling ) and the langues- you are certainly getting marked down because of that.
-------------------------------
#### When you do your first sucesfull emulation######
Bottom - up approach (when you created c model for encoder, verilog and sysverilog codes with archs and etc)
*understand the algorithm and maths of the decryption process (understanding just encryption is not enough and can cause problems and increased complexity in the design implementation) (2 hours)
	*Fault detection coutnermeassure (how do you implement it (just understand the algorithm - EDC (error detection code) and prediction algorithms for EDC codes) - how do you inject faults(necessary for testing) (2 hours)

5 days cushion - for extra revision and final year project

Exams - 20/04 - 28/05

Start writing your report -
 
29/04 - 03/05 - write up 50 - 60 pages in 5 days - start writing it up.

- 02/05 - 05/05 - Kraslava.

- Weeks cushion for finishing up the uncoded things in the report.

- Work with Wasim, if you have got something else for the summer - be relaxed with Wasim,, it is not that serious.
- Redo varpas website in may -june, so that you have your design example - (cool website and map) https://www.nideo.tv/Contact
	- Contact 1-2 freelancer desingers (wireframing) - with explaining each detail of the website.
